<h3>HI THERE!</h3>

My name is Mike Nicklaus Ling, and I am a frontend developer based in Davao City, Philippines. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in Computer Science at Ateneo de Davao University, where I am in my third year of studies.

Beyond coding, I have a strong artistic background in graphic design, portrait sketches, and photography. Initially, my interest was not focused on coding; however, I discovered a passion for frontend development due to its creative elements, particularly in website design and UI/UX design.
