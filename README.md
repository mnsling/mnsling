names Mike, a Frontend Developer from Davao City, Philippines.

I am currently a 3rd Year Student studying Computer Science in Ateneo de Davao University. 

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services as well as apps that have 100M+ installs. I don't have any work experience and such, but I am hoping that one day I can contribute to companies that offer such services.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy exploring and learning various forms of art, including graphic design, portrait sketches, photography, and videography.
